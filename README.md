## 🖥️ Software Development | Coding | Programming

I'm a **proficient Arch Linux user**, using it as my daily development and work environment. I value its control and transparency it offers — traits that aling well with my approach to both language and technology.

In addition to translation, I also work with **software and web development** as part of my professional toolkit.
I use **Python**, and I'm comfortable with **HTML** and **CSS**. I'm also currently learning **Ruby**, and **JavaScript**, expanding my ability to build interactive and dynamic tools for web.

I view software development as a **complementary part of my work**, not just a side passion.
